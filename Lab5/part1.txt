1. background-color: red;
Have it assigned only to specific div, not all divs (#div1 p{background-color: COLOR;})

2. 	margin: 10px;
	padding: 10px;
Added boarder space around the boxes
Extended the boxes

3.
#div1 p{
	background-color: yellow;
	margin: 100px;
	padding: 100px;
}
It moves the "1" outside of the bounderies of the box

4. overflow: hidden;
	overflow: scroll;

	Hidden just hides the extended stuff behind the other divs
	Scroll allows you to scroll inside of the <p> in div1

5. float: left;
1, 2, 3 
float: right;
3, 2, 1

6. for div1:
you have 1 box on left, 3,2 boxes on left, all horizontally parallel
for div2:
have box 1 on top right, box 3 below it. Box 2 is on the left, shifted down by one
for div3:
have box 2,1 on top right, horiztally parallel. Box 3 is on the left, shifted down by one

7. 
div{
	float: left; //applies to all div
}
#div3{
	clear: left; //applies to div3
}

8. <body style="margin: 0px;">
The boxes shift over a little bit to the left
This means that the default value is not 0px
